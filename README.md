# victor-vectors

This is a demo of how to vectorize a pdf corpus with Llamaindex.

The PDFs were curated by Brett Victor, a designer, and are hosted at Victor's site, [Worry Dream](https://worrydream.com/refs).

The vectors are generated by running `vectorize.ts` using the script defined in package.json. 

- Define `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`. 
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- Then you can run `vectorize` if you need to update the vectors.
- Or run `chat` to initiate a chat session with the PDFs.
